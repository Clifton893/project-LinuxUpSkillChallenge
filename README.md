# project: Linux Upskill Challenge
This repository documents my experience with the [Linux Upskill Challenge](https://github.com/livialima/linuxupskillchallenge).

## What is it?
[The Linux Upskill Challenge](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/) was designed as a hands-on, CLI-driven educational exercise aimed at "those who aspire to get Linux-related jobs in the industry - junior Linux sysadmin, DevOps-related work, and similar."
