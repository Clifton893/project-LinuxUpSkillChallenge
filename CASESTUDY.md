## Methods
As a casual Ubuntu user for a decade, I had been looking for exercises to better myself at system administration (particularly at the CLI level).

After some searching, I found something called the “Linux Upskill Challenge,” which caught my attention. Originally a paid course, it was now a free, month-long exercise in remotely administering an Ubuntu Server instance.

The way it was set up, “students” studied/performed an activity and themed lesson each weekday, over the span of a month. Rather than dally and take my time, I finished in [x days].

Basically, each “day’s” lesson consists of a set of tasks, a relevant glossary, and extended reading links, all accompanied by a video for additional context.

I thought it was pretty cool, since it was a clever way to get your hands dirty and have some direction.
